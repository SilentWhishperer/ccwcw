# üîê Usage of Data
The following document shortly provides a description of the data which is collected while playing the game.
By beginning on the registration process a user document is created containing the username (email) and the choosen password encrypted with the leading industry standard [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs). However if one feels uncomfortable with the encryption, one can use a dummy password. You are also able to choose a dummy email to protect your privacy that doesn't need to exist. But make sure to securely save your password as you won't be able to recover it with a fake email as the password recovery follow a two-step verification (1. Request password recovery mail, 2. Click reset password link). As soon one play the game a history of the answers with its according time is logged as it can bee seen from the example below. Those data is used to perstist your game journey if you want to come back in a week üôÇ But we need it also for analytical purpose like average attempts for a task or identifying the difficulties of a task subset.  

To provide further transparency of the data used the whole backed is open source and publicly avaiblable under: [API Project](https://github.com/FHNW-SQL-Training-Game/FHNW-SQL-Training-Game-API)
